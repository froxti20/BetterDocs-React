  - **maintainer_name** - The name of the current maintainer. **only use if it's different from the original developer**. `[OPTIONAL]`
  - **contributor_name** - The name of the person that contributed to this project in any way, shape or form. You can have multiple contributors by using an array. Ex. `[name,name]` `[OPTIONAL]`

  - **github\_profile\_url** - The link to your [Github](https://github.com/) profile.`[OPTIONAL]`
  >You can use **gitlab\_profile\_url** or **npm\_profile\_url** instead (or all) and same goes for the source url
  - **github\_source\_url** - For open-source themes, this URL points to the repo that powers the theme `[OPTIONAL]`
  - **github\_issue\_url** - A link to allow people to get support. (In most cases it should be the [Github issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) url) `[OPTIONAL]`
  - **discord\_server** - A Discord server invite to allow people to get support or give feedback for the theme. `[OPTIONAL]`
  - **demo** - This is a direct url to the file so the [demo](https://betterdocs.netlify.com/demo/dark.html?theme=INSERT-URL-HERE) can work. For Github it need's to be the **raw** url but to fix the MIME type issue you will need to use [githack](https://raw.githack.com) for the url instead (or https://www.jsdelivr.com/?docs=gh). `[OPTIONAL]`

  - **status** - Values: `Updated/Oudated`. The current status of your theme.
  - **snippet** - Values: `true/false`. If your content isn't a full theme you can showcase it as a snippet instead. `[OPTIONAL]`

  - **auto** - If your theme is hosted on [Github](https://github.com) then add `true` to allow users to automatically down the file (or even the entire repo) instead of just' visiting the site, if hosted elsewhere leave blank or remove it entirely. `[REQUIRED]`
  - **style** - Values: `dark/light`. This specifies the setting for the [demo](https://discordsource.com). `[REQUIRED (if using demo)]`
  - **tags** - Tags are in an array and can be seperated with commas "," like so `[tag1,tag2]`. `[OPTIONAL]`
  - **ghcommentid** - ~~The ID of the issue related to your theme so it can be used in our comments system~~. `[REQUIRED]` 
  - **layout** - Used by the [Jekyll](https://github.com//MrRobotjs/BetterDocs/) version of this website. `[REQUIRED]`

  1. If your theme is chosen as featured, hereâ€™s what to do next:
